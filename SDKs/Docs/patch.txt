Overview
This release notes is for updating patch for nVidia PhysX SDK.
The patch is meanly to upgrade the PhysXViewer, optimization on Microsoft XBOX360 and Visual Remote Debugger tool.

Release Notes 

PhysXViewer
Ragdoll making is a very important work in game development. To support artists create Ragdolls with PhysX dynamics, we updated PhysXViewer to help artists to transfer their ragdoll mesh to PhysX assets through NxuStream. Then, engineers can use NxuStream to load the model and to simulate in PhysX world.
New features:
1. Update PhysXViewer to support importing Unreal PSK mesh file 
2. Update Create Dynamics library to support Unreal PSK mesh
3. Update Soft Body tool with interfaces for Unreal PSK mesh
4. Update PhysXViewer document (Samples\PhysXViewer\documentation\PhysXViewer.htm) with usage guide on Create Dynamics
Bug Fix:
1. Fix some path and file extension related bugs in PhysXViewer.


optimization on Microsoft XBOX 360
New features:
1. Update  optimizing code on XBOX360, include colth, softbody, fluid features.
2. Support  using multiple hardware threads on XBOX360 to runing the cloths or softbodies simulation in parallel.
Bug Fix:
1. Fix the incorrect rendering in SampleColth.


Visual Remote Debugger:
Bug Fix: 
1. Fix the incorrect bounding box in Sample Softbody scene 2. 
2. Fix the no responding when reconnect to VRD. 
3. Fix the wrong report of softbody's flag. 
4. Fix the NpCloth::setDampingCoefficient() can not be applied to VRD. 
5. Fix shape's values which are changed by NxShape::SetMatterial(),NxShape::SetSkinWidth(), NxShape::SetName(),NxShape::SetGroupsMask() don't be applied to VRD. 
6. Change the wrong name of some fluids stats, they are:"Static collision restitution" to "Restitution For Static Shapes""Static collision adhesion" to "Dynamic Friction For Static Shapes""Dynamic collision restitution" to "Restitution For Dynamic Shapes""Dynamic collision adhesion" to "Dynamic Friction For Dynamic Shapes" 

New feature: 
1. New Rendering pipeline (using Shaders and VBOs instead of Display Lists).
2. Add the force field implement in VRD, you can get the shape of the force fields by click the 'show force fields -> on' in View menu.
3. Add fluid's emitter's report to scene browser. 
4. Add the report of groups mask to scene browser. 
5. Add convexEdgeThreshold, fomat, sampleStride of NxHeightField report to scene browser.
6. Add wheelFlags of NxWheelShapeDesc report to scene browser.
7. Add skinWidth, groupMask, of NpShape report to scene browser.
8. Add subdivisionLevel, staticStructure, DynamicStructure, UpAxis, backgroundThreadCount, threadMask, InternalThreadCount of NxSceneDesc report to scene browser.
